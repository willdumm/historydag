"""This module provides tools for describing and computing parsimony and
weighted parsimony, and for describing allowed characters and ambiguity codes.

:class:`AmbiguityMap` stores a collection of ``Characters`` (for example the strings
``'A'``, ``'G'``, ``'C'``, and ``'T'``) that are considered valid states, as well as
a mapping between other ``Characters`` ('ambiguity codes') and subsets of these allowed
characters. This type allows forward- and backward-lookup of ambiguity codes.

:class:`TransitionModel` describes transition weights between an ordered collection of
``Characters``, and provides methods for computing weighted parsimony. Functions in
``historydag.parsimony`` accept ``TransitionModel`` objects to customize the implementation
of Sankoff, for example. This class has two subclasses: :class:`UnitTransitionModel`,
which describes unit transition costs between non-identical ``Characters``,
and :class:`SitewiseTransitionModel`, which allows transition costs to depend on the
location in a sequence in which a transition occurs.
